# Hazim Mohamed's Résumé
  This repository contains a LaTex file of my résumé. I chose to host my résumé on GitHub so that I can:
  Branch from the main copy to cater different potential employers
  Go through different iterations to see how I have progressed as a programmer.
  Clearly document differences between my current résumé and previous copies through the git diff feature
  
  
  To compile a copy into pdf I suggest copy and pasting the code into an online LaTex editor such as <a href="https://www.overleaf.com" target="_blank">overleaf</a> or <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com" target="_blank">sharelatex</a>. An alternative method would be to clone the repository and compile locally. More information on how to install and compile LaTex code to PDF <a href="https://guides.lib.wayne.edu/latex/compiling" target="_blank">here</a>.
