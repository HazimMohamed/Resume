# Hazim Mohamed's Résumé
  This repository contains a LaTex file of my résumé. Hosting my résumé on GitHub offers many benefits. I can:
  
  
  + Branch from the main copy to cater different potential employers
  + Progress my resume without losing older copies
  + Have my résumé accessible and organized
  + Clearly document my growth as a programmer through the Git diff feature
  
  
  
  To compile a copy into pdf I suggest copy and pasting the code into an online LaTex editor such as <a href="https://www.overleaf.com" target="_blank">overleaf</a> or <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com" target="_blank">sharelatex</a>. An alternative method would be to clone the repository and compile locally. More information on how to install and compile LaTex code to PDF <a href="https://guides.lib.wayne.edu/latex/compiling" target="_blank">here</a>.
