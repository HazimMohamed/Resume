# Hazim Mohamed's Résumé
  This repository contains a LaTex file of my résumé. I chose to host my résumé on GitHub so that I can:so that I can branch from the main copy to cater different potential employers as well as progress the main copy while still keeping a record of older versions. Feel free to go through different iterations to see how I have progressed as a programmer.
  
  To compile a copy into pdf I suggest copy and pasting the code into an online LaTex editor such as <a href="https://www.overleaf.com" target="_blank">overleaf</a> or <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com" target="_blank">sharelatex</a>. An alternative method would be to clone the repository and compile locally. More information on how to install and compile LaTex code to PDF <a href="https://guides.lib.wayne.edu/latex/compiling" target="_blank">here</a>.
